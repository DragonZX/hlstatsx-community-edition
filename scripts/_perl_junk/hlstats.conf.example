## Database Settings
##

# DBHost - Database server "address" or "address:port". Address can be an IP or
#          a hostname. The default MySQL port is 3306 (tcp).
DBHost ""

# DBUsername - User to connect to the database as.
DBUsername ""

# DBPassword - Password for the database user.
DBPassword ""

# DBName - Name of the database to use.
DBName ""

# DBLowPriority - Use INSERT DELAYED and DELETE LOW_PRIORITY for some queries.
#                 This can give better performance, but may make statistics less
#                 "real time". 1=on 0=off
#	DO NOT ENABLE THIS UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.
#	It will cause more performance issues than it solves on many mysql versions.
DBLowPriority 1

## UDP Socket Settings (should match "logaddress ip port" on the game servers)
##

# BindIP - IP address to bind to (leave empty to use all interfaces).
BindIP ""

# Port - Port to listen on for log data from the game servers. this is also valid for proxy-daemon.pl
Port 27500

# DebugLevel - Set this to 1 to have debugging information printed on stdout.
#              Set higher for even more debugging information. Set to 0 for
#              quiet operation. It is recommended that you set this to 1 when
#              first configuring HLstats, to help diagnose any problems.
DebugLevel 1

# SubmitCrashes - Set this to 1 to report crashes to the HLX:CE team.
#                 If the daemon dies, it will send an HTTP POST request
#                 with the following info: time of crash,
#                 address of last seen server*, last log line received*,
#                 your hlxce version and dbversion, the stats address
#                 of the last seen server*, md5 hashes of your daemon files,
#                 and the text of the error.
#                 Information with an asterisk(*) is only recorded if the main thread dies.
#
#                 This information greatly helps us in finding and debugging issues.
